<h2>Not enough to unpack</h2>
<html><body><p>Suppose you have the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">my_tuple = 1, 2, 'a', 'b'
a, b, *c, d, e = my_tuple</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the tuple has four items, and we want to unpack it into 5 variables. What will happen in this case?</p></body></html>
